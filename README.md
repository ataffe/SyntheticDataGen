# SyntheticDataGenForFLImViz

This is an implementation of Latent Diffusion modified to generate synthetic 
surgical images for Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging surgical images. I rearranged the code from
the [Latent Diffusion Repo](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion) and added the segmentation head from
[Big Dataset GAN](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/bigdatasetgan_code)
